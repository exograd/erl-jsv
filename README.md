# Project
JSV, for JSON Structural Validator, provides a way to validate the structure
and content of JSON data structures.

While similar to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) in intent, JSV is
different in the following ways:

- Definitions are provided as Erlang expressions, and are therefore
  syntactically simpler.
- Modularization is implemented with Erlang modules, instead of the extremely
  complex URI-based reference system of JSON Schema.
- Definitions can be versioned and shared through standard Erlang libraries.

# Documentation
A handbook is available [in the `doc`
